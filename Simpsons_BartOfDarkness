"Bart of Darkness" is the first episode of The Simpsons' sixth season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 4, 1994.[1] It was written by Dan McGrath, and directed by Jim Reardon. In the episode, Bart breaks his leg and becomes increasingly isolated in his room. He starts spying on the neighbors with a telescope and begins to suspect that Ned Flanders has murdered his wife. The episode was produced during the 1994 Northridge earthquake which delayed production by a month, and is largely a parody of the film Rear Window.
